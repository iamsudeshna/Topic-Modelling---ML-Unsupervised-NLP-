# Topic-Modelling---ML-Unsupervised-NLP
Through this task, we wanted to solve categorization or segregation of topics in news articles based on unsupervised machine learning approaches (K-Means, LDA) and visualize those new articles post segregation (SoM) based on how similar they are to one another. We have taken 2 approaches of Unsupervised Machine Learning into consideration
1. K-Means Clustering
2. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
   
For Visualization , we have taken Self Organizing Maps (SoM) By leveraging unsupervised machine learning algorithms, we seek to uncover underlying themes and patterns within large collections of news articles. Moreover, the significance of topic modelling is, it can facilitate content recommendation, trend analysis, and information retrieval, thereby enhancing the user experience and engagement with news content.
